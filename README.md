# Mongo Social Network - Challenge 18

![license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

## Description

In this Module 18 Challenge, we were tasked to build an API for a social network web app, where users share their thoughts, add friends to their friends list, and react to friends' thoughts! We used Express.js for routing, the Mongoose ODM And a MongoDB database. This app wasn't deployed, but we tested all the endpoints in Insomnia Core, which you can see in the walkthrough video. You can peep said walkthrough video here:
